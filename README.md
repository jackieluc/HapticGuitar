# Haptic Guitar

![Haptic Guitar](images/hapticguitar_final.png)

Haptic Guitar is an exploration of computer haptics to simulate the feeling of plucking or strumming virtual strings, as if they were real strings. The goal of this project was to simulate and reproduce the sound made by a string instrument in a virtual environment. We could have reproduced the sound by using pre-recorded sound files. However, we decided to challenge the hardware and software limitations and generate sounds as a direct result of the userâ€™s interactions with the strings. A user can use the Novint Falcon to interact with the guitar strings in three dimensions.
